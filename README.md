# FNN Text Classifier

## About
This software is a FeedForward Network for text classification task, classifying texts according to the labels provided
by the label map file. The software uses SpaCy models to preprocess text data and generate tensors for training. For
now, it natively supports German-language data and classifies trains German-language classifier models, but there
exists a possibility to use other languages.

The network natively uses [10kGNAD](https://tblock.github.io/10kGNAD/) dataset to perform supervised training for text
classification according to 9 labels:
1. Web - internet
2. Panorama - panorama
3. International - international
4. Wirtschaft - economy
5. Sport - sport
6. Inland - internal affairs
7. Etat - budget
8. Wissenschaft - science
9. Kultur - culture

It is possible to use different datasets, label maps, embeddings and SpaCy models for training.

## Contents of the repository
Repository contains
1. `README.md` file: the file you're reading right now.
2. `Data` directory containing label map file, pre-trained embeddings file, dev, test and training data splits. Here you're going
to find the tensor files generated by the preprocessor as well. IF YOU WANT TO USE THE NETWORK FOR OTHER DATA THAN GERMAN,
THE NEW DATA SPLITS, EMBEDDINGS AND LABELS SHOULD BE PLACED HERE. 
3. `Models` directory containing the models trained by the network. By default there is a baseline model created by my
lecturers
4. `UnitTestData` directory containing data for unit testing. If you change the test cases significantly, make sure you
made changes in the directory too.
5. `constants.py` file containing the keys for saving/loading tensor/model files.
6. `preprocessor.py` file with code to preprocess the data and generate dev, test, and training tensors.
7. `trainer.py` file that trains the models.
8. `grid_search.py` file that finds the best parameters for models.
9. `test_preprocessor.py`, `test_trainer.py` and `test_evaluator.py` files to perform unit testing.

## User's Manual
### Step I: Preprocessing
Make sure you have all the desired data in the `Data` directory.
